## TP 5 Notes

- In exercise 1 we did the 3 shaders asked in which subexercise. The hardest to do was the animation shader because we didn't realise the timeFactor connection until a further analysis of the code and the teacher mentioning it in class. 
- In exercise 2 we had difficulties in managing to apply the water texture (texture2 kept appearing). Then, the hardest part was getting the heights right, to do what we think were supposed to be waves. Nothing else to write home about, and we're happy with the result!
