##  Notes on TP2

### Exercises on Section 2
In the first exercise, we were asked to use TP1's figures in order to recreate a tangram picture that was given to us. Ours was PICTURE 12. We observed the same things we did in TP1 in terms of the figures: namely, the fact that only one side was visible when rotating to its back face (except for the parallelogram). Thus, our struggles came in the form of figuring out the direction of rotations (in order to be able to see each figure's color) and the values for the translation.
Specifically, in the first sub-exercise that asked us to do one transformation "the hard way", we found that it was quite hard to figure out on our own - namely, how to, in fact, execute the transformation (in our case, a translation) through code, as the instructions kind of left us grabbing at straws.
The rest of the transformations, done "the easy way", were easier after figuring out the first sub-exercise. In the end, we observed a tangram figure.

### Exercises on Section 3
The second exercise asked us to define a cube at once. After the first batch of exercises, this was definitely easier. The bigger problems were, once again, in extracting info from the instructions (this time, pertaining to what it meant to draw the cube as a base for the tangram figure) and figuring out values for translations and rotations needed.
In the end, we observed a tangram figure "supported" by an unitary cube.

### Exercises on Section 4
The 2nd exercise asked us to define an unitary cube, just like in the previous section, but instead doing it one side (out of 6 in total, of course) at a time. At this point, translations and rotations are easy to do. We noticed, however, that since we weren't working with the cube but with a square that always started in the same initial position, each and every set of transformations for each of the 6 sides was unique.
In the end, we observed the same as we did in Section 3.
