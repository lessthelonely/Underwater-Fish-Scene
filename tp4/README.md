## Group T0xG0y

## TP 4 Notes

(add your main observations/remarks about your experiments here, in a bulleted list, and remove this line. Some examples below)

- In exercise 1, we merely saw our tangram figure, which we're already quite familiar with. Because of our paralelogram, which needed to be reflected, we added the two lights once used in TP3, so we could be able to see the whole figure clearly while working. We didn't take them out as we figured they would suffice for the rest of the exercises. Our big difficulty this time was just getting the texture coordinates for the mapping correct: every time we failed, we noticed errors in the mapping.
- In exercise 2 we had a little hiccup with being able to apply multiple textures in the same object - namely, MyUnitCubeQuad. After we figured that, we also had a little doubt with how to apply the filtering. Outside of that, we merely saw a Minecraft 'Dirt' cube, which made us miss playing the game! With 'LINEAR' activated, the texture became quite blurry; with 'LINEAR' deactivated, it looked more accurate to how it usually looks on Minecraft.
