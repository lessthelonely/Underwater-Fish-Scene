## TP 1 Notes

(add your main observations/remarks about your experiments here, in a bulleted list, and remove this line. Some examples below)

- In exercise 1 we observed the figure whose code we already had available (MyDiamond). We then did the code to draw various figures and we observed them (Triangle, Parallelogram). We had difficulties at the beginning on how to make them "appear" but then we figured out that it was an issue due to our neglicience with the export/import of our classes.
- In exercise 2 we had difficulties in similar aspects, however we were quick to overcome them. We observed  that when drawn together, it's impossible to notice the small triangle because it's drawn on top of the big triangle making it look like it was only drawn the big triangle.

After doing both exercises, we decided to display all the figures together and we made a figure that we did not recognize.
