## TP 3 Notes


- In exercise 1 we created a MyTangram and a MyUnitCube object, besides importing these two classes from TP2, we also imported MyParallelogram, MyTriangle, MyDiamond, MyTriangleSmall, MyTriangleBig in order to compose the MyTangram with no issues.
- In exercise 2 we remade the experiments with our two new objects and as foretold in the exercise, we noticed some differences between our new experiments and the ones made with the objects provided to us.
- In exercise 3 we had some issues displaying the normals for the Tangram but we discovered with the help of our practical teacher what was our issue and managed to see them all with relative ease. 
- In 4 we made a new material, which we named "Wood" with Specular index of(0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1). 
- In 5 we designed 7 materials: green, blue, red, pink,yellow, purple and orange and we applied them to the figure with the corresponding color.
- In exercise 6, we commented the appliance of the material green in diamond. Instead we selected the material "Custom" and we changed the Ambient gradient to a color similar to green.
